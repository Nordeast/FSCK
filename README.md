# FSCK
Fast File system recovery program (myfsck.c)
and a little file system reader (lfsreader.c)

The FSCK is a project for an operating systems class that required us to to recover damaged disk images.

The LFS reader took healthy LFS disk images and allowed you to do ls and cat instructions on them.

Both of these projects were implemented in C.
